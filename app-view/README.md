Hey 👋 As we're in a private repo, no need to be overly formal. First of all, thank you for purchasing AppView and supporting my work!

> Just to reassure you, this is not a project that was thrown together in a weekend. It came from my personal need when I realized how much time I waste overthinking websites for my apps instead of building features in the apps themselves.
>
> So, I've decided this time to really overthink it but just once, and pack everything into a reusable and customizable template.
>
> Took way longer to build this than I anticipated (story of my life tbh) but I'm happy with the final result and truly think it will save you a lot of time and headaches.
