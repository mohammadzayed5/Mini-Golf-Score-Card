## Privacy Policy

Apple requires every app to have a proper privacy policy that explains how user data is collected, used, and protected.

Depending on your app you might just use a simple, one paragraph privacy policy describing what data is collected (if any) in human friendly terms. But for more complex case you might need a more and more formal language.
